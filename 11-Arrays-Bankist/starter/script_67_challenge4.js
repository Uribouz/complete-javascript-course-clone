// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying 
if dogs are eating too much or too little.

Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger 
than the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.

Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is 
within a range 10% above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).

HINT 1: Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰
HINT 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10). 
Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the recommended portion.

TEST DATA:
const dogs = [
  { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice', 'Bob'] },
  { weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ['Matilda'] },
  { weight: 13, curFood: 275, owners: ['Sarah', 'John'] },
  { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ['Michael'] }
];

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
