Source of Data
1) From program it self (constant);
2) From the UI (use input);
3) From external source (API);

Collection of Data --> Data Structure

 Simple List -> Arrays or Sets
 Key/Value Pairs -> Objects or Maps
 

ARRAYS VS SETS

    Arrays: Use 
        when you need ordered list of values.
        when you need to manipulate data.
    Sets: Use
        when you need to work with unique value.
        when high-performance is needed.
        to remove duplicates from arrays.

        
OBJECTS VS MAPS

    Objects:
        traditional key/value store("abused" objects)
        easier to write and access values with . and []
        Use:-
            when you need to include functions (methods)
            when working with JSON.

    Maps: 
        Better performance
        Keys can have any data type
        Easy to iterate
        Easy to compute size
        Use:-
            when you need to map key to valuse
            when you need keys that are not strings
